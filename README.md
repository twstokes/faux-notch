## What is this?

It's a bare-bones example that renders a fake MacBook notch in macOS. It combines AppKit and SwiftUI.

## Why?

I saw where people were making these apps, but didn't see any source code. Maybe someone would find this useful!

## What does it do?

Not much. It's not even pixel perfect! It doesn't factor in the cursor either (e.g. letting the cursor "skip" over it).

Features:
- Shows a notch
- Stays on top of the Menu Bar
